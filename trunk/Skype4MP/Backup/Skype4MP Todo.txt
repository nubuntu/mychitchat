Add a generic Skype image to the main menu?

GUISkype.cs

Still gets confused when >1 call is in progress/held
Specify events/triggers etc to make the MoodText label behave better??

GUISkypeContact.cs

Maybe need to remove blank entries somehow?  Can we configure it dynamically?

-----------------

GUISkypeOut.cs

Need to fix the button labelling somehow - redesign maybe?
Need to test the Intl prefix handling a bit more - is it required?   Should I always add a "+" if there isn't one already?
